You can get the image data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation/data  

For python code -> run only model.py (put the images' folder into "root/ultrasound" directory)

For matlab code -> use all .m files

The latest submission.cvs uses the latest model.py code with only 9% accuracy
